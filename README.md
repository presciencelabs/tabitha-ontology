## Development philosophies

1. classes at end of elements
1. minimal `if`'s
1. code indentation via <kbd>tab</kbd> instead of <kbd>space</kbd>
1. normalize data as close to source as possible, e.g., see how occurrences are handled
1. pure functions, i.e., no changes outside of scope and no more that one arg at a time
1. components should be self-contained, i.e., always let parent be responsible for layout, positioning, etc., component should not assume anything outsode its containment
